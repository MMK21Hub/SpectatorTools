# SpectatorTools
This datapack allows spectators to type `/trigger openToolbox` to open the 'Spectator Toolbox'. From there, they can toggle the following status effects: Night Vision (incresed visibility at night); Conduit Power (incresed visibility underwater); and Fire Ressistance (Incresed visibility under lava).

It also adds in handy links to teleport between the three dimensions. (Does not support custom dimensions.)

It was inspired by [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net)' Spectator Night Vision and Spectator Conduit Power datapacks. Check them out! However, this pack has been built from scratch - I did not reuse any of the code in their packs.

Why choose SpectatorTools over Vanilla Tweaks?
 - Everything in one pack
 - Includes extra features
 - Easily accessible through one chat menu
